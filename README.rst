This project is developing a tool for experimenting with rubber-powered model
airplane trimming parameters.

After I retired from my second profession, I got back into flying model
airplanes, something I did back in high school and college. I enjoy flying
rubber-powered models in gymnasiums, and started back into this hobby by
building a simple model I purchased from Volare Models. Here is what I put
together:

The marking on the model enable it to fly in a "mass launch event" where each
model is marked with pictures of some Hollywood character.
