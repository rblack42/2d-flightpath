Newton's Laws
#############

You probably heard the tale of Isaac Newton sitting under a tree and getting
hit in the head by a falling apple. Odds are that never really happened, but it
makes a good story for kids. The history books tell us that seeing an apple
falling from a tree inspired Isaac to work out how that happened, and why the
apple fell straight down, and not at some other angle. After years of thinking,
Isaac came up with three laws which will guide our study.


1. "Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight
   line unless it is impelled to change that state by forces impressed on it"

2. "Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant
   mass, force equals mass times acceleration."

..	math::

	F = m a

3. "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

Mass vs Weight
**************

You know how much your weigh. Your bathroom scale can tell you this any time
you wish. Some folks obsess over the number they see when they do this. But
what does the number really mean?

Isaac figured out that there was a force pulling two bodies together. We call
this force Gravity. Newton came up with a rule that determined what this force
looked like mathematically [1]_:

..  [1] There is some dispute over whether Newton really came up with this, but
    most folks just accept that this is Newton's work

..  math::

    F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}

Where

    * $F$ - the force between the two bodies in Newtons
    * $G$ - the gravitational constant =  $6.674 X 10^{-11} N\frac{m^2}{kg^2}$
    * $m_1$ - the mass of the first body in kilograms
    * $m_2$ - the mass of the second body in kilograms
    * $r$ - the distance between the center of mass of the two bodies in meters.

In his honor, we have a unit of force called the *Newton* It is defined as the
force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one meter per
second squared in the direction of the applied force.

    * $1 N = 1 kg \frac{m}{s^2}$

Gravity
*******

All objects moving around near the Earth are pulled towards the center of the
planet by a force we call Gravity_.  This force acts on the ball, and will
cause the vertical component of velocity to change as the ball moves.

example
=======

Suppose you weight 170 pounds on your bathroom scale. That number is actually
the force you are exerting on the scale by standing on it. We can calculate
your mass by using the value of gravity on the Earth.

    * 1 pound = 0.45359237 kg

    * 1 pound = 4.44822162 Newtons

    * G = 9.80665 m/s^2

Equations of motion
*******************

At any moment in time, an object is located at some point in space. To keep our
analysis simple, we will assume that our object is moving in a 2-D plane. That
means we will only deal with two coordinate directions, and time:

    * **x** - position measured parallel to the ground (our Earth is flat!)

    * **y** - position measures upward from the Earth (the altitude of the object).

    * **t** - time measured from some initial moment in time in seconds.
